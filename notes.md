							<p>I enjoy learning from others' perspectives and experiences. I am always analyzing and synthesizing information, as both processes enrich my creativity. The tech industry appeals to the adventurer and leader in me, because innovating within it requires an understanding of where we want to go, as well as what destinations are possible given what we have. I am passionate about facilitating progress, while remaining considerate of the relevant constraints and possibilities. I've fallen in love with software engineering because of it's productive mix of idealism and practicality. </p>
